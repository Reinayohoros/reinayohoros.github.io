        <p style = "font-family: Georgia;font-size- 150; text-align:center"> Welcome to my page, my name is Reina Yohoros and i'm a Sophomore at Babson College. I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration with a double concentration in accounting and finance. I was born and raised in Panama, growing up in a close minded third world country has certainly been a rewarding challenge regarding my academic and professional development. In Panama I attended Magen David Academy, an international and jewish high school. During high school I dedicated my time and energy to my favorite sport dance and followed my entrepreneurial pursuit and started my own sustainable swimwear company called Monswim; which I still manage to date. At Babson I’m part of the TAMID organization, this student run organization has developed my interest in consulting and finance. Since freshman year I’ve been exposed to the finance world throughout this organization. I worked on creating the financial analysis for various startup companies in Israel. As well I'm part of the women's finance association, and other clubs. I invite you to explore my page and learn more about myself.</p>
